Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but anything that
would have helped describe the structure of your methods would
be helpful.

Your efficiency is top-notch, no repetition or unnecessary
println commands.  Well done!
